Hi {name},

This is just a quick reminder about the study today ({date}) at {time}. Please
arrive on time, or a bit early if you can. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you may be
assigned as a no-show.

IMPORTANT: please review the guidelines below regarding eye makeup and eyewear.

Eye Makeup: Please avoid heavy eye makeup on the day of the experiment. This
includes thick eyeliner, heavy mascara, glittery or shimmery eyeshadows, and
false eyelashes. Understanding that you may be coming directly from other
commitments, we will provide makeup removal facilities and products in the
lab. This will allow you to participate if you are wearing makeup upon
arrival.

Vision Correction: If you require vision correction, we recommend clear and
non-tinted contact lenses. Glasses, especially those with
thick, reflective, or tinted lenses, can interfere with the eye-tracking
equipment. If you must wear glasses, please choose a pair with thin, plastic
frames and clear, non-reflective lenses.

Location: The study is being run in Meyer 566. If you take one of the main
elevators, you take a right out of the elevator, then your first right, you'll
walk down a hallway and up some stairs, and then when you hit the end of the
hallway, 566 will be directly to your left. If you instead take the side
elevator, you'll come out into a waiting area with seats. Then, the experiment
will be down the hall to your left.

Thanks for participating!

Fred
