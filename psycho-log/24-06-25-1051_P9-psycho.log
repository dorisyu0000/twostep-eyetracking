3.3467 	WARNING 	The 'psychtoolbox' library cannot be loaded but is required for audio capture (use `pip install psychtoolbox` to get it). Microphone recording will be unavailable this session. Note that opening a microphone stream will raise an error.
3.3501 	ERROR 	Support for the `sounddevice` audio backend is not available this session. Please install `psychopy-sounddevice` and restart the session to enable support.
3.3503 	ERROR 	Support for the `pyo` audio backend is not available this session. Please install `psychopy-pyo` and restart the session to enable support.
3.3505 	WARNING 	We strongly recommend you activate the PTB sound engine in PsychoPy prefs as the preferred audio engine. Its timing is vastly superior. Your prefs are currently set to use ['PTB', 'sounddevice', 'pyo', 'pygame'] (in that order).
